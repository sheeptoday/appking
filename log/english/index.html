<p>
This is a part of bigger story. <br>
The King App (representing software application controller¹) and a little girl (representing data model) were searching for a name for the girl.
They had travelled to a swamp filled with various reptilies.
Including the largest one — Array the Monster.

<p>
¹) Don't care about the terms :)

<p>

<p>
— We can't fight the monster alone, — the King said. <br>
— We must go back and find an army.

<p>
The girl wasn't happy about going back.
She didn't expect to meet new friends without an own name.
So she asked: </p>

<p>
— Do we need the army?

<p>
— Сertainly!, — the King answered. <br>
— We need fifty designers to fight Array the Monster.

<p>
— Why fifty designers?


<p>
— For the best effect.
Imagine how it feels when fifty men are running to you and screaming «I'll fix it!».

<p>
The girl had imagined.

<p>
— May I go fight monster without army?, — the girl asked.

<p>
The King had not an objection.
There was a theoretical chance to a little girl had won a huge monster.
But to use this chance we need to update the storyline with superpower or lucky trick.
So the King answered:

<p>
— No. You are a litte girl.
That lucky tricks in storyline are boring.

<p>
— What if I will grow up?, — the gril proposed.

<p>
— Sounds much more interesting!, — the King answered.

<p>
The girl moved to the swamp coast.
She closed her eyes and toke a deep breathe.

<p>
It was very interesting already.
All reptiles from the swamp came closely to see.
After a moment the reptiles made a loud noise with a lot of questions.

<p>
— Have You grow up already? <br>
— How does it feels? <br>
— Why do You look the same? <br>
— Can You say something smart?

<p>
... a much more questions they had asked.

<p>
A young woman smiled and answered once for all the questions.

<p>
— Yes, I have grow up without a trick, — she said. <br>
— I have replaced in the text the <i>«little girl»</i> for the <i>«young women».</i>
I feel myself more responsible now.
For all of You and for anything else in this story.

<p>
— One more question, please!, — said the biggest reptile.

<p>
He was Array the Monster. He moved slowly and had joined to the conference by this moment.

<p>
— How will you defeat me?, — the monster asked. <br>
— As I am as huge as a office building for a common insurance company.
Do You have any responcible solutions in this case?

<p>
— Fifty designers are our solution!, — battlecryed the King.

<p>
He took the sword and was ready to fight.
But the young woman had answered first.

<p>
— I have the solution, — she said. <br>
— Dear Monster, You will tell us about reptiles.
We will listen your lection sharply.
I will take one little lizard in award.
This lizard will represent my name.

<p>
Everyone was agree with the deal. <br>
:)
